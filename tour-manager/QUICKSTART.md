### Setup Steps:

- Add two tabs: "Products" and "Sales"

**2. Get Google Cloud Credentials**

- Add your credentials (see README.md)

**4. Test Sync**

- In Product Setup, click "Sync to Sheet"
- Check your Google Sheet - products appear!

## Offline Mode (Works Automatically!)

The app is **offline-first** which means:

âœ… **Works WITHOUT internet:**

- Make sales
- Add/edit products
- Everything saved locally

âœ… **Syncs when online:**

- Automatic sync when internet returns
- Manual sync button if needed
- Shows pending sales count

Perfect for venues with spotty WiFi!

## Tips for Fast Merch Sales

### Speed Tricks:

1. **Tap-tap-done**: Product â†’ Payment Method â†’ Complete Sale (3 taps!)
2. **Common bundles**: Memorize your common combos (T-shirt + Vinyl = $55)
3. **Keep iPad charged**: Bring a battery pack for long shows
4. **Test before doors**: Do a test sale before fans arrive

### Product Organization:

- Put best-sellers in "Apparel" category (shows first)
- Keep prices simple ($5, $10, $20, $25, $30, $45)
- Use clear product names ("Tour Hoodie" not "Merchandise Item 3")

### Payment Methods:

- **Cash**: Traditional, always works
- **Card**: Square/Stripe reader
- **Venmo**: Super popular with younger fans
- **Other**: Zelle, CashApp, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cart is empty" after reloading?

âœ… This is normal - cart clears on refresh. Sales are still saved!

### Can't see my products?

âœ… Check "Product Setup" tab - they should be there

### Sync not working?

âœ… Check if you're online. If offline, it'll sync later automatically.

### Want to start fresh?

âœ… Clear browser data for the site (clears local database)

## Tour Day Workflow

**Before the Show:**

1. Charge iPad fully
2. Open app (works offline)
3. Check product list is correct
4. Do a test sale and delete it

**During Merch Rush:**

1. Stay in "Point of Sale" tab
2. Fast taps: Product â†’ Quantity â†’ Payment â†’ Complete
3. Don't worry about syncing - it happens automatically

**After the Show:**

1. Let app sync when you get WiFi
2. Check Google Sheet for total sales
3. Count cash vs. what the app says
4. Pack up and celebrate a great show! ðŸŽ¸
