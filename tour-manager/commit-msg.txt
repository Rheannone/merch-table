Fix critical Promise race condition and synced flag bugs

ISSUE #1 (CRITICAL): Fix Promise race condition in debounced Sheets sync
- Changed pendingProductSheetsSyncResolve (single) to pendingProductSheetsSyncResolves (array)
- Problem: With 5 rapid product updates, only last Promise resolved, 4 hung forever
- Impact: Queue items stuck in processing, UI showed syncing indefinitely
- Solution: Push all resolve functions to array, resolve ALL when timeout fires
- Files: src/lib/sync/strategies.ts

ISSUE #6 (MEDIUM): Fix edited products keeping synced: true
- ProductManager preserved synced status from Supabase-loaded products on edit
- Changed to always set synced: false on edits
- Files: src/components/ProductManager.tsx

Build: Successful
